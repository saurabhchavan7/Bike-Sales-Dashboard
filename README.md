## Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw bike sales data.
- Analyze the data using pivot tables and charts.
- Create a visually appealing and informative dashboard.
- Implement interactive features using slicers to allow dynamic data filtering.

## Features and Tools Used

### Data Cleaning
- Removed unnecessary columns and rows.
- Handled missing data and ensured data consistency.

### Data Analysis
- **Pivot Tables:** Used pivot tables to summarize data, calculate averages, and aggregate data based on different criteria such as age brackets, marital status, region, and education level.
- **Charts:** Created various types of charts (e.g., bar charts, line charts) to visualize the summarized data.
- **Conditional Formatting:** Applied conditional formatting to highlight important trends and patterns in the data.
- **Formulas and Functions:** Utilized Excel formulas and functions (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE, IF statements) to perform calculations and derive insights from the data.
- **Data Validation:** Applied data validation to ensure data accuracy and consistency in user inputs.

### Interactive Features
- **Slicers:** Implemented slicers for interactive filtering, allowing users to dynamically change the data displayed on the dashboard based on selected criteria.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Preparation:** Cleaned the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **Creating Pivot Tables:** Generated pivot tables to summarize and analyze the data.
3. **Designing Charts:** Created charts based on pivot table data to visualize trends and insights.
4. **Building the Dashboard:** Assembled the charts into a cohesive dashboard, added a header, and formatted the layout for clarity.
5. **Adding Interactivity:** Introduced slicers to enable dynamic filtering of the data, making the dashboard interactive and user-friendly.
